# Usage: run_each_unit_test.sh <dir> [first-nonskipped-test]
# 
# Run all the tests in the given directory.  
# If a first-nonskipped-test is given, then skip all tests until that 
#  file is found, then resume testing.
#
# The ilastik test suite shouldn't be run from the standard 'nosetests' command, 
#  because some of the tests (GUI tests) can't be run that way.
#  (It has to do with the fact that these tests need to take control of the main thread, 
#  which means nosetests must be running in a separate thread.)
# 
# This simple bash script runs all tests in the current directory:
# - Only runs files with the word 'test' in their name
# - For files with 'gui' in the filename, the file is run directly
# - For all other files, the special 'nose_single' helper script is used.
